we need to shore up
our defenses.

135
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:50,077
The only thing standing
between us and the Army
of the Dead is the Wall,

136
00:12:50,077 --> 00:12:53,994
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

137

I'm not the king

- ( men murmuring )
- Jon: Aye.

142
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,910
Last time we saw
the Night King was
at Hardhome.

143
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,244
The closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

144
00:13:12,244 --> 00:13:13,785
Then that's
where I'll go.

145

( chatter )

147
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:20,827
If they breach
the Wall,

148
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:22,368
the first two castles
in their path

149
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,910
are Last Hearth
and Karhold.

150
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,577
The Umbers
and the Karstarks
betrayed the North.

151
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:30,202
Their castles
should be torn down

152
00:13:30,202 --> 00:13:31,952
with not a stone
left standing.

153

The castles
committed no crimes.

154
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:37,952
And we need
every fortress we have
for the war to come.

155
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:41,286

The Umbers
and the Karstarks

159
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:51,827
have fought beside
the Starks for centuries.

160
00:13:51,827 --> 00:13:55,994
- They've kept faith for
generation after generation.
- And then they broke faith.

161
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:59,077
I'm not going to
strip these families
of their ancestral homes

162
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:01,660
because of the crimes
of a few reckless sons.

163
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,327
Sansa:
So there's no punishment
for treason

164
00:14:03,327 --> 00:14:05,827
and no reward
for loyalty?

165
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:13,660
The punishment
for treason is death.

166
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,493
Smalljon Umber died
on the field of battle.

167
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:19,327
Harald Karstark died
on the field of battle.

168
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:21,744
They died
fighting for Ramsay.

169
00:14:21,744 --> 00:14:23,327
Give the castles
to the families

170
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:25,702
of the men who died
fighting for you.

171
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:28,869
( men chattering,
pounding tables )

172
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,827
When I was Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch...

173
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:45,660
I executed men
who betrayed me.

174
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,910
I executed men who
refused to follow orders.

175
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,702
My father always said,

176
00:14:51,702 --> 00:14:54,286
"The man
who passes the sentence
should swing the sword,"

177
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:57,577
and I have tried
to live by those words.

178
00:14:57,577 --> 00:15:01,036
But I will not punish a son
for his father's sins,

179
00:15:01,036 --> 00:15:03,493
and I will not take
a family home away

180
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:06,869
from a family it has
belonged to for centuries.

181
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:09,452
That is my decision,

182
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:12,036
and my decision is final.

183
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:19,244
Ned Umber.

184
00:15:27,244 --> 00:15:28,577
Alys Karstark.

185
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:45,410
For centuries,
our families fought

186
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,244
side by side
on the battlefield.

187
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:53,244
I ask you
to pledge your loyalty
once again to House Stark,

188
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,785
to serve
as our bannermen

189
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:58,493
and come to our aid
whenever called upon.

190
00:16:07,286 --> 00:16:08,410
Stand.

191
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:14,910
Yesterday's wars
don't matter anymore.

192
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,910
The North needs
to band together,

193
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,286
all the living north.

194
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:22,952
Will you stand beside me,
Ned and Alys,

195
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:25,202
now and always?

196
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:27,660
Both:
Now and always!

197
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,244
( men cheering,
pounding tables )

198
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:49,036
Jon:
You are my sister,
but I am king now.

199
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:50,660
Will you start
wearing a crown?

200
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,286
When you question
my decisions

201
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:54,452
in front of
the other lords and ladies,
you undermine me.

202
00:16:54,452 --> 00:16:57,161
- So I can't question
your decisions anymore?
- Of course you can, but--

203
00:16:57,161 --> 00:16:59,493
Joffrey never let anyone
question his authority.

204
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:01,493
You think
he was a good king?

205
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:05,119
Do you think
I'm Joffrey?

206
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:11,660
You're as far from Joffrey
as anyone I've ever met.

207
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,161
Thank you.

208
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,869
You're good at this,
you know.

209
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,327
- At what?
- At ruling.

210
00:17:19,327 --> 00:17:21,161
( sighs )
No.

211
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:22,036
You are.

212
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:24,660
You are.

213
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:28,452
They respect you,
they really do,

214
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:30,618
- but you have to--
- ( chuckles )

215
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:32,036
Why are you laughing?

216
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:34,202
What did father
used to say?

217
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:37,535
Everything before
the word "but"
is horse shit.

218
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,036
He never
said that to me.

219
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:41,744
No. No, he never cursed
in front of his girls.

220
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:44,827
Sansa:
Because he was trying
to protect us.

221
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:47,827
He never wanted us to see
how dirty the world really is,

222
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:50,535
but Father
couldn't protect me
and neither can you.

223
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:53,244
- Stop trying.
- All right, I'll stop
trying to protect you

224
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:54,618
and you stop trying
to undermine me.

225
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:56,827
I'm not trying
to undermine you!

226
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:01,410
You have to be
smarter than Father.

227
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,077
You need to be
smarter than Robb.

228
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:07,202
I loved them, I miss them,
but they made stupid mistakes,

229
00:18:07,202 --> 00:18:09,244
and they both
lost their heads for it.

230
00:18:09,244 --> 00:18:11,452
And how should
I be smarter?

231
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:12,910
By listening to you?

232
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:18,244
Would that be
so terrible?

233
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:21,202
A raven from
King's Landing,
Your Grace.

234
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:33,244
"Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

235
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:35,161
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

236
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:36,785
Protector of
the Seven Kingdoms--"

237
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:38,244
What does she want?

238
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,286
( sighs )
Come to King's Landing.

239
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:46,119
Bend the knee or suffer
the fate of all traitors.

240
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:48,244
You've been so consumed
with the enemy to the north,

241
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:50,077
you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

242
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:53,119
I'm consumed
with the Night King
because I've seen him.

243
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,744
And believe me, you'd think
of little else if you had, too.

244
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:57,452
We still have
a wall between us
and the Night King.

245
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:59,286
There's nothing
between us and Cersei.

246
00:18:59,286 --> 00:19:02,202
There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

247
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:04,994
Winter is here.
The Lannisters are
a southern army.

248
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,452
They've never ranged
this far north.

249
00:19:06,452 --> 00:19:09,785
You're the military man,
but I know her.

250
00:19:09,785 --> 00:19:13,119
If you're her enemy,
she'll never stop until
she's destroyed you.

251
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,286
Everyone who's
ever crossed her,
she's found a way to murder.

252
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,452
You almost sound
as if you admire her.

253
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:27,286
I learned
a great deal from her.

254
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,994
What is this?

255
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:08,660
It's what we've been
waiting for our whole lives.

256
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,452
It's what Father trained us for,
whether he knew it or not.

257
00:20:11,452 --> 00:20:12,952
He knew it.

258
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:14,910
Made me memorize
every damn city, town,

259
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,493
lake, forest,
and mountain.

260
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:18,660
It's ours now.
We just have to take it.

261
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,535
You've been quiet
since you came home.

262
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:23,994
Are you angry
with me?

263
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:26,244
No, not angry.

264
00:20:27,368 --> 00:20:28,327
Are you afraid of me?

265
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:31,493
Should I be?

266
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:39,202
Daenerys Targaryen
has chosen Tyrion
to be her Hand.

267
00:20:39,202 --> 00:20:41,994
Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

268
00:20:41,994 --> 00:20:44,994
hoping to take back
her father's throne.

269
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,410
Our little brother,

270
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,577
the one you love
so much,

271
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:51,410
the one you set free,

272
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,702
the one who
murdered our father
and our first-born son,

273
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:58,036
now he stands
beside our enemies
and gives them counsel.

274
00:21:01,744 --> 00:21:05,744
He's out there somewhere
at the head of an armada.

275
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:07,452
Where will they land?

276
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:11,577
Dragonstone.

277
00:21:11,577 --> 00:21:14,368
They have
deep-water ports
for the ships.

278
00:21:14,368 --> 00:21:16,368
Stannis left
the castle unoccupied,

279
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:17,827
and that's where
she was born.

280
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:20,119
Enemies to the east.

281
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,910
Enemies to the south--

282
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,910
Ellaria Sand
and her brood of bitches.

283
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,744
Enemies to the west--

284
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,577
Olenna, the old cunt.

285
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:31,785
Another traitor.

286
00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:33,952
Enemies to the north.

287
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:37,077
Ned Stark's bastard has been
named King in the North

288
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:40,077
and that murdering whore
Sansa stands beside him.

289
00:21:40,077 --> 00:21:42,744
Enemies everywhere.
We're surrounded by traitors.

290
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:44,452
You're in command
of the Lannister army now.

291
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:47,577
- How do we proceed?
- Winter is here.

292
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:50,869
We can't win a war
if we can't feed our men
and our horses.

293
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:55,036
The Tyrells have the grain,
the Tyrells have the livestock.

294
00:21:55,036 --> 00:21:57,077
Will the Tyrell bannermen
stand alongside

295
00:21:57,077 --> 00:22:00,368
a Dothraki horde
and Unsullied slave soldiers?

296
00:22:00,368 --> 00:22:03,036
If they think
Daenerys will win.

297
00:22:03,036 --> 00:22:04,994
No one wants to fight
on the losing side.

298
00:22:04,994 --> 00:22:08,119
Right now,
we look like
the losing side.

299
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,244
I'm the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

300
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:13,994
Three kingdoms, at best.

301
00:22:13,994 --> 00:22:16,535
I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

302
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,327
I understand we're
in a war for survival.

303
00:22:18,327 --> 00:22:21,368
I understand
whoever loses dies.

304
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:23,660
I understand whoever wins
could launch a dynasty

305
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,244
that lasts
a thousand years.

306
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,827
A dynasty for whom?

307
00:22:27,827 --> 00:22:30,827
Our children are dead.

308
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:32,286
We're the last of us.

309
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:34,327
A dynasty
for us, then.

310
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:39,036
We never talked
about Tommen.

311
00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:43,994
There's nothing to say.

312
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:45,952
Our baby boy
killed himself.

313
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:47,493
He betrayed me.

314
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:48,994
He betrayed us both.

315
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:50,827
Should we spend our days
mourning the dead--

316
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,244
mother, father,
and all our children?

317
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:54,827
- Cersei--
- I loved them. I did.

318
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:58,036
But they're ashes now
and we're still flesh
and blood.

319
00:22:58,036 --> 00:23:01,036
We're the last Lannisters,
the last ones who count.

320
00:23:06,869 --> 00:23:09,535
Even Lannisters can't
survive without allies.

321
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:12,702
Where are
our allies now?

322
00:23:12,702 --> 00:23:14,910
You saw what happened
to Walder Frey and
his family.

323
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,577
I heard.

324
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:19,119
- How could we ever trust
a man like that?
- We couldn't.

325
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,119
He was a useless,
old coward,

326
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,952
but the Freys
supported us.

327
00:23:22,952 --> 00:23:24,327
Now they're all dead.

328
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:26,036
Whoever killed them
is no friend of ours.

329
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:27,577
We need allies.

330
00:23:27,577 --> 00:23:29,368
Stronger,
better allies.

331
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:31,493
We can't win
this war alone.

332
00:23:33,493 --> 00:23:37,119
You think I listened
to Father for 40 years
and learned nothing?

333
00:23:41,994 --> 00:23:44,535
( seagulls screeching )

334
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,618
Jaime:
The Greyjoys?

335
00:24:15,618 --> 00:24:18,202
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

336
00:24:18,202 --> 00:24:21,036
- Not all of them.
- Well, it looks like
all of them.

337
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:22,618
I invited
Euron Greyjoy,

338
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:25,119
the new King
of the Iron Islands.

339
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,827
You said yourself
we needed stronger,
better allies.

340
00:24:27,827 --> 00:24:30,952
- There you are.
- How are they better allies?

341
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:33,368
How are they different
from the Freys?

342
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:34,952
They both broke
their promises

343
00:24:34,952 --> 00:24:37,244
and murdered
their former friends
as soon as it suited them.

344
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:40,244
So does everyone
when it suits them.

345
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:42,869
Unlike the Freys,
they have ships.

346
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:45,493
- And they're good at killing.
- They're not good at anything.

347
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:48,910
I know the ironborn.
They're bitter, angry
little people.

348
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,119
All they know how to do
is steal things they can't
build or grow themselves.

349
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,244
Euron Greyjoy didn't
come here for that.

350
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:56,286
Oh, what did
he come here for, then?

351
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,952
A queen.

352
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,869
Euron:
The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

353
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:16,244
they turned on me.
( chuckles )

354
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:17,493
Their own uncle.

355
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:20,119
They stole
my best ships and ran.

356
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,286
Sailed them
right across the world

357
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:24,577
and gave them
to the Dragon Queen

358
00:25:24,577 --> 00:25:28,036
so she could bring
her armies here
to attack you.

359
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:31,493
It's nothing compared
to the treason you suffered

360
00:25:31,493 --> 00:25:35,161
at the hands
of a family member,
from what I hear.

361
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:37,869
But still,
it bothers me.

362
00:25:39,493 --> 00:25:42,535
Murdering them would
make me feel a lot better.

363
00:25:42,535 --> 00:25:46,702
And since it appears
that all our treasonous
family members

364
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:48,618
are fighting
for the same side,

365
00:25:48,618 --> 00:25:51,161
I thought
we rightful monarchs

366
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:53,744
could murder them
together.

367
00:25:59,744 --> 00:26:02,535
You're not
a rightful monarch,
though, are you?

368
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,660
The Greyjoys
rebelled against the throne
for the right to be monarchs,

369
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,702
but as I recall,
you were soundly defeated.

370
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:15,535
Come to mention it,

371
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:17,910
weren't you the one
who started that rebellion

372
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,119
by sailing to Casterly Rock
and burning the Lannister fleet?

373
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,827
You certainly
caught us there.

374
00:26:23,827 --> 00:26:26,660
Very smart move
on your part.

375
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,910
Of course,
we all made it to
the Iron Islands anyway.

376
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,119
I was there.

377
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,952
I remember very well.

378
00:26:33,952 --> 00:26:35,493
I saw you.

379
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,785
I heard so much talk.

380
00:26:37,785 --> 00:26:41,410
The best in the world.
No one can stop him.

381
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,119
I didn't believe it,
to be honest.

382
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,410
But I must say
when you rushed
through the breach

383
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,577
and started
cutting people down...

384
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,785
it was glorious.

385
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:55,202
Like a dance.

386
00:26:55,202 --> 00:26:58,410
The people
I was cutting down
were your own kin.

387
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,744
The place
was getting crowded.

388
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,327
I enjoyed watching it.
I truly did.

389
00:27:03,327 --> 00:27:05,535
And I enjoyed
killing Greyjoys.

390
00:27:05,535 --> 00:27:07,994
A good thing for me.

391
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:11,618
If you hadn't crushed us,
I wouldn't have gone
into exile.

392
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:13,535
If I hadn't done that,

393
00:27:13,535 --> 00:27:17,119
I wouldn't be
the greatest captain
on the 14 seas.

394
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:19,994
If not the most humble.

395
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:22,286
You're not humble.

396
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:26,244
You're the queen
of a great nation.

397
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:29,202
You don't care about
the Iron Islands.

398
00:27:29,202 --> 00:27:33,869
They're nothing but rocks
and bird shit and--

399
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:36,744
and a lot of very
unattractive people.

400
00:27:36,744 --> 00:27:39,368
The Iron Fleet,
on the other hand,

401
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:42,493
that's something else
entirely.

402
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:45,785
It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

403
00:27:45,785 --> 00:27:50,368
With the Iron Fleet,
you own the seas.

404
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:53,202
You can defeat
the invaders of the east

405
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:56,161
and the pretenders
of the north and south.

406
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:57,785
What do you want
in return?

407
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:02,910
Ever since
I was a little boy,

408
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,827
I wanted to grow up
and marry

409
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,952
the most beautiful woman
in the world.

410
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:09,660
So here I am,

411
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,119
with a thousand ships

412
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,660
and two good hands.

413
00:28:19,077 --> 00:28:20,660
I decline your proposal.

414
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,202
Why?

415
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,869
You're not trustworthy.

416
00:28:27,286 --> 00:28:29,368
You've broken promises
to allies before

417
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:31,827
and murdered them
at the nearest opportunity.

418
00:28:31,827 --> 00:28:33,368
You murdered
your own brother.

419
00:28:34,702 --> 00:28:37,036
You should try it.
Feels wonderful.

420
00:28:37,036 --> 00:28:38,660
( laughs )

421
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,702
I don't expect you
to trust me outright.

422
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:43,077
You need proof
of my honest intentions.

423
00:28:43,077 --> 00:28:44,535
In my experience,

424
00:28:44,535 --> 00:28:47,535
the surest way
to a woman's heart
is with a gift.

425
00:28:47,535 --> 00:28:49,827
A priceless gift.

426
00:28:49,827 --> 00:28:51,702
I won't return
to King's Landing

427
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:53,744
until I have that
for you.

428
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:37,119
( labored breathing )

429
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,910
- ( man breathing heavily )
- ( men coughing )

430
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,077
( farts, groans )

431
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:46,410
( gagging )

432
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,161
- ( flies buzzing )
- ( coughs )

433
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,286
( grunts )

434
00:29:57,286 --> 00:29:58,618
( sighs )

435
00:29:58,618 --> 00:30:00,910
( chatter )

436
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:18,410
( gagging )

437
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,119
( sighs )

438
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,286
( gags )

439
00:30:32,493 --> 00:30:34,036
( gags )

440
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:34,952
( scraping )

441
00:30:37,994 --> 00:30:39,493
( exhales )

442
00:30:39,493 --> 00:30:40,327
( gags )

443
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:44,452
( gags )

444
00:30:51,368 --> 00:30:52,827
( coughs )

445
00:31:19,036 --> 00:31:20,910
( gate rattles )

446
00:31:30,244 --> 00:31:32,244
( chain rattling )

447
00:31:46,577 --> 00:31:49,702
( gate closes )

448
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,577
Ah, Maester Weyland.

449
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:06,077
( grunts )
A drinker's liver
if ever I saw one.

450
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:08,286
Weigh that.

451
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:12,785
The triumph
of transitory pleasures.

452
00:32:12,785 --> 00:32:14,702
Mankind's curse.

453
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:17,785
Archmaester,
I was wondering...

454
00:32:17,785 --> 00:32:19,744
What's the weight?

455
00:32:19,744 --> 00:32:22,702
Um, 147.

456
00:32:25,618 --> 00:32:28,702
I was wondering if you had
considered my proposition.

457
00:32:28,702 --> 00:32:31,785
I don't remember
your proposition.

458
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:35,077
I asked you if,
in light of what
I've seen in the North,

459
00:32:35,077 --> 00:32:38,244
if I could have access
to the restricted area
of the library.

460
00:32:38,244 --> 00:32:39,952
That area is reserved
for maesters.

461
00:32:39,952 --> 00:32:42,452
- Are you a maester?
- No.

462
00:32:42,452 --> 00:32:44,577
Not a very strong
proposition, is it?

463
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:56,535
Archmaester,
with respect,

464
00:32:56,535 --> 00:32:58,368
I've seen them--

465
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,618
the Army of the Dead.

466
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:02,994
The white walkers.

467
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:05,493
I was sent here to learn
how to defeat them,

468
00:33:05,493 --> 00:33:08,036
but everyone
in the Citadel,

469
00:33:08,036 --> 00:33:10,202
those who will even
talk to me,

470
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:13,036
they all doubt
the walkers ever existed
in the first place.

471
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:15,577
Everyone in the Citadel
doubts everything.

472
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,660
It's their job.

473
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:25,493
But the tales
of the Long Night
can't be pure fabrication.

474
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:30,244
Too many similarities
from unconnected sources.

475
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:32,827
Sources in
the restricted area?

476
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:34,452
The very same.

477
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,202
And the simplest
explanation

478
00:33:37,202 --> 00:33:40,161
for your grating obsession
with the white walkers

479
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:41,660
is that you're
telling the truth

480
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,785
and that you saw
what you say you saw.

481
00:33:44,785 --> 00:33:47,660
So, you believe me.

482
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,493
I do.

483
00:33:50,493 --> 00:33:52,202
You'll finish
weighing that heart?

484
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:57,327
That makes you
the only person
south of the Twins who does.

485
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:03,202
We're not like the people
south of the Twins.

486
00:34:03,202 --> 00:34:05,410
And we're not
like the people
north of the Twins.

487
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:11,660
In the Citadel,
we lead different lives
for different reasons.

488
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:16,327
We are this world's memory,
Samwell Tarly.

489
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:19,286
Without us, men would be
little better than dogs.

490
00:34:19,286 --> 00:34:21,452
Don't remember
any meal but the last,

491
00:34:21,452 --> 00:34:24,119
can't see forward
to any but the next.

492
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,286
And every time
you leave the house
and shut the door,

493
00:34:26,286 --> 00:34:29,202
they howl like
you're gone forever.

494
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:32,202
When Robert's Rebellion
was raging,

495
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:34,036
people thought
the end was near.

496
00:34:34,036 --> 00:34:37,119
The end of
the Targaryen dynasty.
"How will we survive?"

497
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,577
When Aegon Targaryen
turned his eye westward

498
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:42,535
and flew his dragons
to Blackwater Rush--

499
00:34:42,535 --> 00:34:44,577
"The end is near!
How will we survive?"

500
00:34:44,577 --> 00:34:47,452
And thousands
of years before that,
during the Long Night,

501
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,577
we can forgive them
for thinking it truly
was the end.

502
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:52,286
But it wasn't.
None of it was.

503
00:34:54,077 --> 00:34:56,618
The Wall has stood
through it all.

504
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,869
And every winter
that ever came has ended.

505
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:11,244
Be a good lad.
Clean this up.

506
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,952
( men snoring )

507
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:01,036
( both grunting )

508
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:02,744
- Nope.
- ( grunts )

509
00:36:09,618 --> 00:36:11,327
( grunting )

510
00:36:13,827 --> 00:36:14,869
- Nope.
- ( grunts )

511
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:24,161
( groans )

512
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,327
You're a lucky man.

513
00:36:33,785 --> 00:36:36,660
Littlefinger:
I've heard she beat
the Hound in single combat.

514
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:42,952
She's a very
impressive woman.

515
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,493
What do you want,
Lord Baelish?

516
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:51,869
I want you
to be happy.

517
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:54,244
I want you
to be safe.

518
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:55,535
I am safe.

519
00:36:55,535 --> 00:36:58,702
I'm at home,
surrounded by friends.

520
00:36:58,702 --> 00:37:02,077
I have Brienne to protect me
from anyone who would harm me.

521
00:37:05,952 --> 00:37:07,744
What about happy?

522
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,244
Why aren't you happy?

523
00:37:12,244 --> 00:37:14,202
What do you want
that you do not have?

524
00:37:14,202 --> 00:37:16,952
At the moment,
peace and quiet.

525
00:37:16,952 --> 00:37:19,368
( footsteps approaching )

526
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:25,244
No need to seize
the last word,
Lord Baelish.

527
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,618
I'll assume it was
something clever.

528
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:31,452
Littlefinger:
My lady.

529
00:37:31,452 --> 00:37:33,244
My lady.

530
00:37:43,744 --> 00:37:45,286
Why is he still here?

531
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:48,036
( sighs )
We need his men.

532
00:37:48,036 --> 00:37:51,618
Without the Vale,
Ramsay Bolton would
still hold this castle.

533
00:37:53,077 --> 00:37:54,618
Littlefinger saved us.

534
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:00,410
Brienne:
He wants something.

535
00:38:02,202 --> 00:38:04,535
I know exactly
what he wants.

536
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:09,660
( bird screeching )

537
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,286
Man:
♪ He rode through
the streets of the city ♪

538
00:38:13,286 --> 00:38:16,327
♪ Down from
his hill on high ♪

539
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,910
♪ O'er the winds and the steps
and the cobbles ♪

540
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,410
♪ He rode
to a woman's sigh ♪

541
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:26,618
♪ For she was
his secret treasure ♪

542
00:38:26,618 --> 00:38:30,036
♪ She was his shame
and his bliss ♪

543
00:38:30,036 --> 00:38:32,952
♪ And a chain and a keep
are nothing ♪

544
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:35,618
♪ Compared to
a woman's kiss ♪

545
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:39,119
Men:
♪ For hands of gold

546
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,785
♪ But a woman's hands

547
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:45,618
♪ For hands of gold

548
00:38:45,618 --> 00:38:48,618
- ♪ But a woman's hands are-- ♪
- ( horse nickers )

549
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,368
That's a pretty song.

550
00:38:51,368 --> 00:38:52,452
I've never
heard it before.

551
00:38:52,452 --> 00:38:53,910
It's a new one.

552
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,910
Man #2:
Are you hungry?
We've got some rabbit.

553
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,368
I don't want
to steal your food.

554
00:38:58,368 --> 00:39:00,744
You're not stealing,
we're offering.

555
00:39:00,744 --> 00:39:03,119
Come on,
it's gonna be
a cold night.

556
00:39:31,618 --> 00:39:33,119
You heading south?

557
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,202
King's Landing.

558
00:39:35,202 --> 00:39:37,286
- Poor girl.
- ( men chuckling )

559
00:39:37,286 --> 00:39:39,952
Not so bad, is it?

560
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:42,077
Depends on your taste,
I guess.

561
00:39:42,077 --> 00:39:45,368
If you like your streets covered
in shit and pig's blood,
it's the town for you.

562
00:39:45,368 --> 00:39:48,202
- ( men chuckle )
- Man #2: All my life,
I wanted to see the Red Keep,

563
00:39:48,202 --> 00:39:50,368
the Sept of Baelor,
the Dragonpit.

564
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:52,327
Then when
I finally make it,

565
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:54,535
they wouldn't
let me within a mile
of the Red Keep,

566
00:39:54,535 --> 00:39:56,493
the Sept of Baelor's
blown to hell,

567
00:39:56,493 --> 00:39:58,452
and the Dragonpit
is a damn ruin.

568
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:00,327
- ( men laugh )
- The people who live there,

569
00:40:00,327 --> 00:40:03,036
they'd skin you alive
if they could make two
coppers off your hide.

570
00:40:03,036 --> 00:40:05,161
Worst place
in the world.

571
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:07,535
What are you doing
in the Riverlands?

572
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:10,119
There's been
some trouble with the Freys
up at the Twins,

573
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:13,452
so we're part of the army
that's been sent to
keep the peace.

574
00:40:16,535 --> 00:40:19,368
Here you go.
Guests first.

575
00:40:19,368 --> 00:40:21,493
Oh, no, I couldn't.
You don't have enough.

576
00:40:21,493 --> 00:40:23,952
My mother always told me
to be kind to strangers.

577
00:40:23,952 --> 00:40:25,910
Strangers
will be kind to you.

578
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,493
You're a long way
from home.

579
00:40:40,493 --> 00:40:42,577
I'm sure you've had
some adventures, though.

580
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:45,410
Yeah,
endless adventures.

581
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,077
- They'll be singing about us
for a thousand years.
- ( men laugh )

582
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:51,744
The truth is
when we left home,
we couldn't wait to get away.

583
00:40:51,744 --> 00:40:54,077
But now we've
been gone a while,
we can't wait to get home.

584
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:58,119
I just think
about my dad out there
on his boat all alone.

585
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,493
I ought to be
out there with him.

586
00:41:01,618 --> 00:41:03,452
My wife just had
our first baby.

587
00:41:03,452 --> 00:41:05,744
- Boy or girl?
- Oh, who knows?

588
00:41:05,744 --> 00:41:07,910
You think soldiers
get ravens with
news from home?

589
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,452
( men laugh )

590
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,368
- I hope it's a girl.
- Why?

591
00:41:14,368 --> 00:41:17,327
Girls take care of their papas
when their papas grow old.

592
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:19,327
Boys just go off to fight
in someone else's wars.

593
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:23,910
Man #2:
Are you old enough
to drink?

594
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,368
( laughing )

595
00:41:39,368 --> 00:41:41,244
It's blackberry wine.

596
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:42,535
I made it myself.

597
00:41:43,994 --> 00:41:45,119
It's really good.

598
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:50,618
So, why is
a nice girl on her own
heading to King's Landing?

599
00:41:58,161 --> 00:42:00,161
I'm going to kill
the queen.

600
00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:19,244
( wind howling )

601
00:42:21,618 --> 00:42:23,535
Thoros:
Bad night
to be outdoors.

602
00:42:23,535 --> 00:42:26,368
The Hound: You've got
real powerful magic
to figure that out.

603
00:42:26,368 --> 00:42:30,452
Did the Lord of Light
whisper that in your ear?

604
00:42:30,452 --> 00:42:33,618
"It's snowing, Thoros.
It's windy.

605
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:36,577
It's gonna be
a cold night."

606
00:42:36,577 --> 00:42:40,452
You're a grouchy old bear,
aren't you, Clegane?

607
00:42:40,452 --> 00:42:42,119
You want some rum?

608
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,202
Don't like that shit.
It's too sweet.

609
00:42:45,202 --> 00:42:47,244
Why are you always
in such a foul mood?

610
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,535
Experience.

611
00:42:55,702 --> 00:42:57,994
This seems
like a good place
to spend the night.

612
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,077
These people
don't want us here.

613
00:43:03,077 --> 00:43:05,994
Beric:
Seems deserted to me.
No livestock.

614
00:43:05,994 --> 00:43:07,952
No smoke coming
from the chimney.

615
00:43:27,493 --> 00:43:28,910
I don't like
the look of it.

616
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,910
For a big, hard man,
you scare easy.

617
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,535
I'll tell you
what doesn't scare me--

618
00:43:34,535 --> 00:43:36,535
bald cocksuckers
like you.

619
00:43:36,535 --> 00:43:39,410
You think
you're fooling anyone
with that top knot?

620
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,202
Bald cunt.

621
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:44,827
Come on.

622
00:43:44,827 --> 00:43:46,660
Maybe they've got
some ale hidden away.

623
00:43:48,327 --> 00:43:49,785
They don't.

624
00:43:49,785 --> 00:43:52,702
( distant men chattering )

625
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:54,368
See if there's a larder.

626
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:56,077
They always leave
something behind.

627
00:44:11,493 --> 00:44:12,493
( blows )

628
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,952
( distant chatter
continues )

629
00:44:37,744 --> 00:44:39,036
How do you think
it ended for them?

630
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,869
With death.

631
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:44,827
Girl died
in her father's arms.

632
00:44:44,827 --> 00:44:47,660
Both of them covered in blood
and a knife at their feet.

633
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:51,785
I'd say
they were starving.

634
00:44:51,785 --> 00:44:53,702
And rather than
let his little girl suffer,

635
00:44:53,702 --> 00:44:55,660
he ended it
for both of them.

636
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,910
Doesn't matter now.

637
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,702
No, doesn't matter now.

638
00:45:07,202 --> 00:45:09,702
( grunts, sighs )

639
00:45:14,452 --> 00:45:16,869
I've known you
a long time, Dondarrion.

640
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:18,368
Aye.

641
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:22,452
I think the first time we met
was at that tournament--

642
00:45:22,452 --> 00:45:25,702
And I always thought
you were dull as dirt.

643
00:45:25,702 --> 00:45:27,036
( chuckles )

644
00:45:27,036 --> 00:45:28,785
You're not bad.

645
00:45:28,785 --> 00:45:30,161
I don't hate you.

646
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:32,535
Don't like you,
but you're not bad.

647
00:45:32,535 --> 00:45:34,368
Thank you, Clegane.

648
00:45:34,368 --> 00:45:35,702
That warms the heart.

649
00:45:35,702 --> 00:45:38,368
But there's nothing
special about you.

650
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,202
You're right about that.

651
00:45:40,202 --> 00:45:43,660
So why does
the Lord of Light
keep bringing you back?

652
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:47,036
I've met better men
than you,

653
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:51,952
and they've been hanged
from crossbeams,
or beheaded,

654
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:56,827
or just
shat themselves to death
in a field somewhere.

655
00:45:56,827 --> 00:45:59,910
None of them came back.

656
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,493
So, why you?

657
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:04,410
You think I don't
ask myself that?

658
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:07,577
Every hour
of every day?

659
00:46:07,577 --> 00:46:09,244
Why am I here?

660
00:46:10,618 --> 00:46:12,410
What am I
supposed to do?

661
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:14,202
What does the Lord
see in me?

662
00:46:16,202 --> 00:46:17,535
And?

663
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:21,910
I don't know.

664
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,910
I don't understand
our Lord.

665
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,744
Your  Lord.

666
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:27,535
I don't know
what He wants from me.

667
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:32,036
I only know that
He wants me alive.

668
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:36,327
If he's so all-powerful,
why doesn't he just tell you
what the fuck he wants?

669
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,202
Thoros:
Clegane.

670
00:46:40,202 --> 00:46:41,577
Come over here.

671
00:46:44,244 --> 00:46:45,952
Don't worry.
The fire won't bite.

672
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:50,244
I want to show you
something.

673
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:53,452
It's my fucking luck
I end up with a band
of fire worshippers.

674
00:46:54,618 --> 00:46:55,952
Aye.

675
00:46:55,952 --> 00:46:58,286
Almost seems like
divine justice.

676
00:46:58,286 --> 00:47:00,827
There's no divine justice,
you dumb cunt.

677
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:03,952
If there was,
you'd be dead...

678
00:47:03,952 --> 00:47:06,119
and that girl
would be alive.

679
00:47:12,493 --> 00:47:15,327
- What do you want?
- Look into the flames.

680
00:47:15,327 --> 00:47:17,452
I don't want to look
in the damn flames.

681
00:47:17,452 --> 00:47:20,994
You saw me
bring him back from the dead
after you cut him down.

682
00:47:22,618 --> 00:47:24,869
Don't you want to know
what gave me the power?

683
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:28,327
I keep asking
and no one wants
to tell me.

684
00:47:28,327 --> 00:47:29,827
We can't tell you.

685
00:47:29,827 --> 00:47:31,994
Only the fire
can tell you.

686
00:47:44,577 --> 00:47:46,036
What do you see?

687
00:47:47,785 --> 00:47:49,244
Logs burning.

688
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:51,327
Keep looking.

689
00:47:56,994 --> 00:47:58,202
What do you see?

690
00:48:07,702 --> 00:48:10,410
Ice.

691
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:12,327
A wall of ice.

692
00:48:14,744 --> 00:48:15,744
The  Wall.

693
00:48:18,535 --> 00:48:19,785
What else?

694
00:48:19,785 --> 00:48:23,994
It's where the Wall
meets the sea.

695
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,410
There's a castle there.

696
00:48:34,827 --> 00:48:36,327
There's a mountain.

697
00:48:36,327 --> 00:48:39,785
Looks like an arrowhead.

698
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,577
The dead are
marching past.

699
00:48:49,535 --> 00:48:51,368
Thousands of them.

700
00:48:57,493 --> 00:48:58,910
Do you believe me
now, Clegane?

701
00:49:00,535 --> 00:49:02,535
Do you believe
we're here for a reason?

702
00:49:08,577 --> 00:49:11,577
( shovel scraping )

703
00:49:20,535 --> 00:49:22,744
( man grunting )

704
00:49:25,744 --> 00:49:28,286
- ( grunting )
- ( shovel scraping )

705
00:49:34,202 --> 00:49:35,785
What the hell
are you doing, Clegane?

706
00:49:39,202 --> 00:49:40,785
Burying the dead.

707
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:55,994
You knew these people.

708
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:57,493
Not really.

709
00:50:57,994 --> 00:51:01,827
We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy.

710
00:51:01,827 --> 00:51:04,869
We ask the Mother to...

711
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:09,869
Fuck it, I don't
remember the rest.

712
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:19,368
I'm sorry you're dead.

713
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:22,286
You deserved better.

714
00:51:22,286 --> 00:51:23,286
Both of you.

715
00:51:32,036 --> 00:51:35,036
( horse trotting,
nickers )

716
00:51:35,036 --> 00:51:36,785
( dog barking )

717
00:51:36,785 --> 00:51:40,077
( chatter )

718
00:51:45,452 --> 00:51:47,244
( Little Sam coos )

719
00:51:47,244 --> 00:51:48,910
Gilly:
Hey.

720
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,286
( Gilly laughs )

721
00:51:51,493 --> 00:51:52,577
( Little Sam grunts )

722
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:55,493
Mom.

723
00:51:55,493 --> 00:51:57,244
You should
really sleep, Sam.

724
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:00,244
The dead don't.

725
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,452
(  Little Sam babbling )

726
00:52:09,452 --> 00:52:12,618
"Legends of the Long Night."

727
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:17,618
The Targaryens
used dragonglass
to decorate their weapons

728
00:52:17,618 --> 00:52:20,161
without even knowing
what the First Men
used it for.

729
00:52:23,744 --> 00:52:25,119
( sighs )

730
00:52:37,452 --> 00:52:38,452
What is it?

731
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:42,202
It's a map
of Dragonstone.

732
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:44,493
The Targaryens built
their first stronghold there

733
00:52:44,493 --> 00:52:46,286
when they invaded
Westeros.

734
00:52:48,994 --> 00:52:50,744
That's dragonglass?

735
00:52:50,744 --> 00:52:52,493
A mountain of it.

736
00:52:52,493 --> 00:52:53,660
Beneath the ground.

737
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,994
Stannis told me,
but I didn't think...

738
00:52:55,994 --> 00:52:59,493
This is important.
Jon needs to know.

739
00:53:09,994 --> 00:53:11,535
( man coughing )

740
00:53:28,368 --> 00:53:30,702
( man vomiting,
coughing )

741
00:53:46,827 --> 00:53:48,827
( gasps )

742
00:53:48,827 --> 00:53:50,744
( panting )

743
00:53:52,785 --> 00:53:54,869
Jorah:
Has she come yet?

744
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:56,493
Who?

745
00:53:56,493 --> 00:53:58,702
The Dragon Queen.

746
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,660
Daenerys Stormborn.

747
00:54:02,368 --> 00:54:03,577
Haven't heard anything.

748
00:54:13,493 --> 00:54:15,952
( seagulls screeching )

749
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,869
( dragons screeching )

750
00:54:38,327 --> 00:54:41,785
( screeching )

751
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,577
Shall we begin?

752
00:59:45,577 --> 00:59:48,410
( music playing )

753
00:59:56,577 --> 00:59:59,077
( choir singing )

754
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:08,660
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

755
01:01:09,827 --> 01:01:12,410
CERSEI LANNISTER:
The Mad King's daughter
will destroy the realm.

756
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,161
We have an army
of fleets and three dragons.

757
01:01:15,785 --> 01:01:17,660
We should hit
King's Landing now.

758
01:01:17,994 --> 01:01:19,202
(GROWLS)
